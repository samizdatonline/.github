# Samizdat

This project is intended to break through the DNS barriers commonly used to censor information in countries that prefer propaganda over true reporting. It provides a relay to respected global news outlets, masking the dns and ip behind a large randomized pool of addresses.

It is not perfect. It could also be construed as illegal content scraping or ad blocking. We hope to ensure that any site is delivered as close to the original as possible (without cookies), and will only render content in locations where that content is unreachable.

This is a not-for-profit effort, licensed to the public with no expectations or restrictions. Just hope.

How to Participate
If you are a developer, please help embellish and troubleshoot. If you are a publisher, please contact us. If you are a lawyer, help us navigate the guardrails of international IP law. If you simply care, register random domains (get name ideas from http://raul.help/id or http://raul.help/id?length=20). If you have some idle computer power, install the app and let us know its IP address.

If you happen to be part of the W3C, please make this project unnecessary. DNS should not be abused for political gain. The open Internet is focused on ensuring the integrity and validation of domain names, so we can trust the source, whatever the source is; but that mechanism is being used to hide the Internet and hide free press. The world wants both integrity and access.
