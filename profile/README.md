# Samizdat

This project is intended to break through the DNS barriers commonly used to censor information in countries that prefer propaganda over true reporting. It provides a relay to respected global media outlets, masking the dns and ip behind a large randomized pool of addresses.

If you happen to be part of the W3C, please make this project unnecessary. DNS should not be abused for political gain. The open Internet is focused on ensuring the integrity and validation of domain names, so we can trust the source, whatever the source is; but that mechanism is being used to hide the Internet and hide free press. The world wants both integrity and access.
